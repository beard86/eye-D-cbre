GUIDANCE NOTE ON THIRD PARTY 
INFORMATION MEMORANDA
Where an Owner/Franchisee seeks to offer or sell an interest in the ownership entity, the asset and/or the business of a hotel it will typically involve the promotion of the investment opportunity by way of an offering document (generally referred to as an “Investment Memorandum”). Hilton Worldwide seeks to insulate itself from the risks associated with the offer of such investment opportunities and consequently we seek to regulate our association with them.  Prior to issue, Hilton Worldwide will review this Investment Memorandum to ensure that the following issues are dealt with and our approval will not be forthcoming until they are: Inclusion in the Investment Memorandum of an appropriate disclaimer (see “Notice” below) in relation to the investment and any information provided in it. Use of our name, marks and branding (whether in text or images i.e. photos of Hilton Worldwide hotel properties, etc) should be limited to strictly descriptive references of fact. For example, it is acceptable to reference that a MA/FA has been entered into for the management/franchise of the hotel and to confirm the approved trading name, but use of our names, marks and branding should not give an overt impression of endorsement / approval of Hilton Worldwide. The investment in question is an investment in the opportunity being offered not an investment in Hilton Worldwide or its Brands. Use of our feasibility projections, estimates and other forecasts are NOT permitted in any circumstances.  Attributing Hilton as a provider of historic financial information is not permitted
Accuracy / completeness of information relating to Hilton Worldwide should not include: Statements or quotes from Hilton Worldwide, officers or employees. Discussion of our future plans and other forward looking statements.
Information that is not in the public domain. Links to our websites. Use of confidential information is not permitted e.g. terms of our contracts (MA or FA).
If the Investment Memorandum is proposed to be issued prior to entry into of a binding MA or FA, any reference to Hilton Worldwide is most likely not going to be appropriate.
